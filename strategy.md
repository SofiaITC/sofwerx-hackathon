# SOFWERX Hackathon: [Grey Pill](http://www.hackathon.io/openwerx-data1)
## Purpose
Communities are growing on the internet, but they are using decentralized architectures, peer-to-peer protocols, and cultural codes; the challenge is to explore these new ecosystems and develop novel data science techniques to illuminate them.

## Communities
### [Steemit](https://steemit.com)
Steemit is a 'social economy' where users are rewarded for their contributions in cryptocurrency. Other Steemit users upvote content, which rewards posters.

### [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social)
Mastodon is an open-source, distributed social network, with the feel of Twitter/Facebook before they were super popular. Users can post, which shows in their local feed and the federated feed.

## Strategy
### Steemit

- Grab all posts currently in `hot` and `trending` topics.
- For each post, gather user and content information, including text and pictures.
- Within each post, gather all replies -- both poster information and content
- Capture data for a social network; content posters will have node-level attributes for their content and picture sentiment
- Visualize network connections (comments or upvotes)
- Calculate network statistics and potentially, community membership or ERGMs for structure
